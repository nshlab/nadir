#' Super Learner: Cross-Validation Based Ensemble Learning
#'
#' Super learning with functional programming!
#'
#' The goal of any super learner is to use cross-validation and a
#' set of candidate learners to 1) evaluate how the learners perform
#' on held out data and 2) to use that evaluation to produce a weighted
#' average (for continuous super learner) or to pick a best learner (for
#' discrete super learner) of the specified candidate learners.
#'
#' Super learner and its statistically desirable properties have been written
#' about at length, including at least the following references:
#'
#'   * <https://biostats.bepress.com/ucbbiostat/paper222/>
#'   * <https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/laan/Class/Class_subpages/BASS_sec1_3.1.pdf>
#'
#' `nadir::super_learner` adopts several user-interface design-perspectives
#' that will be useful to know in understanding what it does and how it works:
#'
#'   * The specification of learners should be _very flexible_, really only
#'   constrained by the fact that candidate learners should be designed
#'   for the same prediction problem but their details can wildly vary
#'   from learner to learner.
#'   * It should be easy to specify a customized or new learner.
#'
#' `nadir::super_learner` at its core accepts `data`,
#' a `formula` (a single one passed to `formulas` is fine),
#' and a list of `learners`.
#'
#' `learners` are taken to be lists of functions of the following specification:
#'
#'   * a learner must accept a `data` and `formula` argument,
#'   * a learner may accept more arguments, and
#'   * a learner must return a prediction function that accepts `newdata` and
#' produces a vector of prediction values given `newdata`.
#'
#' In essence, a learner is specified to be a function taking (`data`, `formula`, ...)
#' and returning a _closure_ (see <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html#closures> for an introduction to closures)
#' which is a function accepting `newdata` returning predictions.
#'
#' Since many candidate learners will have hyperparameters that should be tuned,
#' like depth of trees in random forests, or the `lambda` parameter for `glmnet`,
#' extra arguments can be passed to each learner via the `extra_learner_args`
#' argument. `extra_learner_args` should be a list of lists, one list of
#' extra arguments for each learner. If no additional arguments are needed
#' for some learners, but some learners you're using do require additional
#' arguments, you can just put a `NULL` value into the `extra_learner_args`.
#' See the examples.
#'
#' In order to seamlessly support using features implemented by extensions
#' to the formula syntax (like random effects formatted like random intercepts or slopes that use the
#' `(age | strata)` syntax in
#' `lme4` or splines like `s(age | strata)` in `mgcv`), we allow for the
#' `formulas` argument to either be one fixed formula that
#' `super_learner` will use for all the models, or a vector of formulas,
#' one for each learner specified.
#'
#' Note that in the examples a mean-squared-error (mse) is calculated on
#' the same training/test set, and this is only useful as a crude diagnostic to
#' see that super_learner is working. A more rigorous performance metric to
#' evaluate `super_learner` on is the cv-rmse produced by cv_super_learner.
#'
#' @param data Data to use in training a `super_learner`.
#' @param learners A list of predictor/closure-returning-functions. See Details.
#' @param formulas Either a single regression formula or a vector of regression formulas.
#' @param y_variable Typically `y_variable` can be inferred automatically from the `formulas`, but if needed, the y_variable can be specified explicitly.
#' @param n_folds The number of cross-validation folds to use in constructing the `super_learner`.
#' @param determine_super_learner_weights A function/method to determine the weights for each of the candidate `learners`. The default is to use `determine_super_learner_weights_nnls`.
#' @param ensemble_or_discrete Defaults to `'ensemble'`, but can be set to `'discrete'`. Discrete \code{super_learner()} chooses only one of the candidate learners to have weight 1 in the resulting prediction algorithm,
#'   while \code{ensemble} \code{super_learner()} combines predictions from 1 or more candidate learners, with respective weights adding up to 1.
#' @param cv_schema A function that takes `data`, `n_folds` and returns a list containing `training_data` and `validation_data`, each of which are lists of `n_folds` data frames.
#' @param outcome_type One of 'continuous', 'binary', 'multiclass', or 'density'. \code{outcome_type} is used to infer the correct \code{determine_super_learner_weights} function if it is not explicitly passed.
#' @param extra_learner_args A list of equal length to the `learners` with additional arguments to pass to each of the specified learners.
#' @param cluster_ids (default: null) If specified, clusters will either be entirely assigned to training or validation (not both) in each cross-validation split.
#' @param strata_ids (default: null) If specified, strata are balanced across training and validation splits so that strata appear in both the training and validation splits.
#' @param weights If specified, (per observation) weights are used to
#'   indicate that risk minimization across models (i.e., the meta-learning
#'   step) should be targeted to higher weight observations.
#' @param use_complete_cases (default: FALSE) If the \code{data} passed have any NA or NaN missing data, restrict the \code{data} to
#'   \code{data[complete.cases(data),]}.
#' @returns An object of class inheriting from \code{nadir_sl_model}. This is an S3 object,
#' with elements including a \code{$predict(newdata)} method, and some information
#' about the fit model including \code{y_variable}, \code{outcome_type}, \code{learner_weights},
#' \code{holdout_predictions} and optionally information about any errors thrown by the
#' learner fitting process.
