#' Determine SuperLearner Weights with Nonnegative Least Squares
#'
#' This function accepts a dataframe that is structured to have
#' one column `Y` and other columns with unique names corresponding to
#' different model predictions for `Y`, and it will use nonnegative
#' least squares to determine the weights to use for a SuperLearner.
#'
#' @param data A data frame consisting of an outcome (y_variable) and
#' other columns corresponding to predictions from candidate learners.
#' @param y_variable The string name of the outcome column in `data`.
#' @param obs_weights A vector of weights for each observation that dictate
#'   how prediction should be more targeted to higher weighted observations.
#' @returns A vector of weights to be used for each of the learners.
